# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

## Description

This project builds a data product based on the *diamonds* data set from package gglot2. It consists of:

- Presentation slides: See Rstudio Presenter file (Rpres)
- Shiny source code: See folder /shiny
- Application hosting site: https://espensvendsen.shinyapps.io/shiny/

These artifacts are intended to be self-documented. The application inludes an About page to explain its usage to new users.
